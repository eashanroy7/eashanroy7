With a strong foundation in Cloud DevOps and backend, I bring a unique blend of skills to architect, build, automate, and optimize cloud-native applications not only in terms of the application code, but also the underlying infrastructure that is needed to host them. My 3+ years of work experience spans AWS, Azure, GCP, Terraform, Python, CI CD, and Kubernetes, where I’ve delivered reliable, scalable, secure, and cost-efficient solutions while ensuring seamless development and deployment processes.

Technical Skills:

Programming Languages: Python, Go, Java, SQL, shell scripting
Database Systems: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, NoSQL
