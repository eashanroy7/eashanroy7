## Hi, I'm Eashan 👋

I’m a **Software Engineer** focused on **backend**, **distributed systems** and **AI/ML infra** - building and optimizing APIs, distributed services, and infrastructure for AI applications.

### What I’m best at
- **Backend & distributed systems:** API design, data modeling, concurrency, reliability, performance, high-scale
- **Platform/infra:** CI/CD, cloud deployments, Kubernetes, observability, authn/authz
- **MLOps:** automating deployment of machine learning models at scale, edge optimization, audit/logging

### Highlights (recent work)
- Designed and developed a flagship API platform for automating computer vision model training at Plainsight Technologies https://plainsight.ai/
- Developed an open-source frame deduplication component that uses motion analysis, perceptual hash and SSIM to skip redundant GPU inference at the edge https://github.com/PlainsightAI/filter-frame-dedup
- Led the development of 'OpenFilter', an open-source framework for building modular computer vision pipelines for edge inference https://github.com/PlainsightAI/openfilter

### Highlights (academic)
- Inducted into Society of Distinction as one of the top 100 graduate students at Northeastern University for exceptional leadership and academic impact (selected from 20,000+ students across 13 global campuses) https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/04/15/laurel-scroll-induction-ceremony-2025/

### Roles I’m targeting
- **SWE-1 / SWE-2** - **Backend**, **MLOps**, **Platform/Infrastructure**, **Developer Productivity**
